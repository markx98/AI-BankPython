## Introduction

This project aims to analyze and determine the best score of all clients in a bank using AI techniques in Python. It involves data processing, score calculation, and generating insights about client scores. The project is designed to be user-friendly, scalable, and easily integrable with existing banking systems.

## Features

- **Data Ingestion:** Load client data from various sources such as CSV, Excel, or databases.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- **Score Calculation:** Calculate scores for each client using a defined scoring algorithm.
- **Best Score Identification:** Identify the client with the highest score.
- **Reporting:** Generate reports and visualizations to present the results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for interactive data analysis)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/markx98/IA-Bank-Python.git
cd IA-Bank-Python
```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
